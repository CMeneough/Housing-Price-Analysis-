Regression Analysis of Repeat Housing Sales in Virginia

Regression Analysis of the determinants of housing prices in Fairfax County, Virginia.

I have repeat sales data, allowing me to control for many of the unobservable housing characterisitcs. In addition, I have a rich set of housing characteristic controls. I have also merged in metro access data to control for location specific transportation advantages. 

This is my first project running a regression in python instead of stata. I found the data cleaning and filtering easier in python but the regression itself was a bit less intuitive.
